# CTBoneSegmentation
## Description
Segmenting `skull bone` in medical images (head CT scans of the patients). 

## Approach
We can use two approaches for the task. First one is `Traditional Methods` and second one is `Deep Learning`.

### Tradtional Methods
These image processing methods basically separate out different parts of the images based on the **intensity values** of the pixels.
