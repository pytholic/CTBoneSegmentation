# CTBoneSegmentation
## Description
Segmenting `skull bone` in medical images (head CT scans of the patients). 

## Overview
We can use two approaches for the task. The first one is `Traditional Methods` and the second one is `Deep Learning`.

### Traditional Methods
These image processing methods basically separate out different parts of the images based on the **intensity values** of the pixels.
Some of the basic operations used are.

* Thresholding
* Windowing
* Morphology (Eroision, Dilation, Opening etc.)
* Blurring
* Masking and so on.
